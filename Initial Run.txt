## WHAT I NEED YOU TO BUILD

**Option A: Python Script (Preferred)**
A Python script that uses WordPress REST API to create all pages, categories, and menus remotely.

**Option B: PHP Setup Script (Alternative)**
A single PHP file I can upload to WordPress that creates everything when I visit it once.

**Choose whichever is easier and more reliable.**

# About MenWellbeing

**Most men's wellness sites get it wrong.**

They either tell you to buy supplements and gear like that'll fix everything, or they tell you material things don't matter and you just need therapy and meditation.

**Both approaches miss the point.**

## What You Want. What You Need.

Real wellbeing isn't either/or. It's both.

Some days, getting a new fishing rod or setting up a home gym actually helps. Having control over something tangible matters. Taking care of your car, your space, your body—these things aren't shallow. They're part of taking care of yourself.

But gear and hobbies aren't substitutes for dealing with the hard stuff. Divorce, burnout, loneliness, mental health struggles—you can't buy your way out of those. Sometimes you need actual support from actual people.

**This site exists because both things are true:**
- Taking care of the controllable stuff (your gear, your hobbies, your daily habits) genuinely improves your quality of life
- Getting real help with the uncontrollable stuff (your relationships, your mental health, your purpose) is how you actually heal

## What We Do

**What I Want** - Product research, gear guides, and recommendations for the tangible things that make daily life better. Cars, outdoor equipment, fitness gear, grooming, workspace setup. Honest takes on what's worth buying based on thorough research and real user feedback.

**What I Need** - Real resources for the harder stuff. Therapists who get men's issues. Support groups that don't suck. Divorce resources. Mental health help. Career coaches. The support you might need but won't always ask for.

## Our Approach

We don't shame you for wanting nice things. We also don't pretend that buying things fixes everything.

No guru bullshit. No "alpha male" nonsense. No generic wellness advice written by people who've never been through anything.

Just honest information about products worth buying and resources worth using, written for men who are dealing with real life.

## What Makes This Different

Most men's sites are either:
- Affiliate content farms that'll recommend anything for a commission
- Therapy-speak that doesn't understand how men actually talk
- Toxic masculinity garbage that makes everything worse

We're none of those.

**This is a resource site**, not a personal brand. We research products thoroughly, recommend support services that actually help, and write in plain language about things that matter.

If you're here because you're going through something hard—divorce, career crisis, mental health struggles, or just feeling lost—you're not alone. Millions of men are dealing with the same things. Some gear helps with the day-to-day. Real support helps with the deeper stuff. Both are okay to need.
